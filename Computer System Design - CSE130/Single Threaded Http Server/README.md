This project is a single threaded HTTP server using sockets that supports GET and PUT requests to read and write files and stores them into the server. 


Instructions:

Run the makefile
	- $ make

Run the server in one terminal - use sudo to avoid any permission errors
	- $ sudo ./httpserver ip port

Use curl commands in another terminal that are directed to the ip and port that are specified when you booted up the server.
